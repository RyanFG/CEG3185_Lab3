# CEG3185_Lab3

This is run using two terminals, one for the PacketSender.java and one for the PacketReceiver.java

How to Run:
PacketReceiver should be started first otherwise connection will not be able to be established.

In the command line for the PacketReceiver the user will enter:
"java PacketReceiver portNumber"
and in the command line for PacketSender the user will enter:
"java PacketSender address portNumber"

From here connection between the client and the server has been established
the user can now enter stuff into the command line and it will be sent to
the receiver where it is then printed onto the screen.
